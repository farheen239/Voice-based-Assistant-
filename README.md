Project Overview
This project is a student-level prototype of a voice assistant built using an ESP32 development board.
It captures voice through a microphone, processes the command, connects to the internet, and plays the response through a speaker.

Objective
To understand the complete working flow of a real voice assistant system using low-cost embedded hardware.
